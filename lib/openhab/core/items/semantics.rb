    module Items
      # Module for implementing semantics helper methods on {Item} in order to easily navigate
      # the {https://www.openhab.org/docs/tutorial/model.html Semantic Model} in your scripts.
      # This can be extremely useful to find related items in rules that are executed for any member of a group.
      #
      # Wraps {org.openhab.core.model.script.actions.Semantics} as well as adding a few additional convenience methods.
      # Also includes classes for each semantic tag.
      #
      # Be warned that the Semantic model is stricter than can actually be
      # described by tags and groups on an Item. It makes assumptions that any
      # given item only belongs to one semantic type ({Location}, {Equipment}, {Point}).
      #
      # ## Enumerable helper methods
      #
      # {Enumerable Enumerable helper methods} are also provided to complement the semantic model. These methods can be
      # chained together to find specific item(s) based on custom tags or group memberships that are outside
      # the semantic model.
      #
      # The Enumerable helper methods apply to:
      #
      # * {GroupItem#members} and {GroupItem#all_members}. This includes semantic
      #   {#location} and {#equipment} because they are also group items.
      #   An exception is for Equipments that are an item (not a group)
      # * Array of items, such as the return value of {Enumerable#equipments}, {Enumerable#locations},
      #   {Enumerable#points}, {Enumerable#tagged}, {Enumerable#not_tagged}, {Enumerable#member_of},
      #   {Enumerable#not_member_of}, {Enumerable#members} methods, etc.
      # * {OpenHAB::DSL.items items[]} hash which contains all items in the system.
      #
      # ## Semantic Classes
      #
      # Each [Semantic
      # Tag](https://github.com/openhab/openhab-core/blob/main/bundles/org.openhab.core.semantics/model/SemanticTags.csv)
      # has a corresponding class within the {org.openhab.core.semantics} class hierarchy.
      # These "semantic classes" are available as constants in the {Semantics} module with the corresponding name.
      # The following table illustrates the semantic constants:
      #
      # | Semantic Constant       | openHAB's Semantic Class                               |
      # | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
      # | `Semantics::LivingRoom` | `org.openhab.core.semantics.model.location.LivingRoom` |
      # | `Semantics::Lightbulb`  | `org.openhab.core.semantics.model.equipment.Lightbulb` |
      # | `Semantics::Control`    | `org.openhab.core.semantics.model.point.Control`       |
      # | `Semantics::Switch`     | `org.openhab.core.semantics.model.point.Switch`        |
      # | `Semantics::Power`      | `org.openhab.core.semantics.model.property.Power`      |
      # | ...                     | ...                                                    |
      #
      # These constants can be used as arguments to the {#points},
      # {Enumerable#locations} and {Enumerable#equipments} methods to filter
      # their results. They can also be compared against the return value of
      # {#semantic_type}, {#location_type}, {#equipment_type}, {#point_type},
      # and {#property_type}. They can even be used with
      # {DSL::Items::ItemBuilder#tag}.

      # @example Finding a related item that doesn't fit in the semantic model
      #   # We can use custom tags to identify certain items that don't quite fit in the semantic model.
      #   # The extensions to the Enumerable mentioned above can help in this scenario.
      #
      #   # In the following example, the TV `Equipment` has three `Points`. However, we are using custom tags
      #   # `Application` and `Channel` to identify the corresponding points, since the semantic model
      #   # doesn't have a specific property for them.
      #
      #   # Here, we use Enumerable#tagged
      #   # to find the point with the custom tag that we want.
      #
      #   # Item model:
      #   Group   gTVPower
      #   Group   lLivingRoom                                 [ "LivingRoom" ]
      #
      #   Group   eTV             "TV"       (lLivingRoom)    [ "Television" ]
      #   Switch  TV_Power        "Power"    (eTV, gTVPower)  [ "Switch", "Power" ]
      #   String  TV_Application  "App"      (eTV)            [ "Control", "Application" ]
      #   String  TV_Channel      "Channel"  (eTV)            [ "Control", "Channel" ]
      #
      #   # Rule:
      #   rule 'Switch TV to Netflix on startup' do
      #     changed gTVPower.members, to: ON
      #     run do |event|
      #       application = event.item.points.tagged('Application').first
      #       application << 'netflix'
      #     end
      #   end
