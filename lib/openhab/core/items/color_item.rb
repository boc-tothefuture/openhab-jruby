      # {ColorItem} represents a color values, e.g. for LED lights.
      #
      # Note that it inherits from {DimmerItem}, so you can call {#on}, {#off},
      # {#on?}, {#off?}, etc. on it. Its state type is an {HSBType},
      # which is stored as Hue, Saturation, and Brightness, but has easy
      # helpers for working with RGB values of various forms.
      #
      # @example Sending commands
      #   HueBulb << "#ff0000" # send 'red' as a command
      #   HueBulb.on
      #   HueBulb.dim
      #
      # @example Inspect state
      #   HueBulb.on? # => true
      #   HueBulb.state.red # => 100%
      #   HueBulb.state.hue # => 0 °
      #   HueBulb.state.brightness # => 100%
      #   HueBulb.state.to_rgb # => [100%, 0%, 0%]
      #   HueBulb.state.rgb # => 16711680
