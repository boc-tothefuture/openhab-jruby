#
# Additions to Enumerable to allow easily filtering and commanding groups of items.
#
# @example Turn on all members of a group
#   gOutsideLights.members.on
#
# @example Turn on all lights that are tagged `NightLights`
#   items.tagged("NightLights").on
#
# @example Close all blinds in the same room when the TV is turned on
#   rule "Close Blinds" do
#     changed gTVPower.members, to: ON
#     triggered do |item|
#       item.location
#           .equipments(Semantics::Blinds)
#           .points(Semantics::OpenLevel)
#           .down
#     end
#   end
#
# @example {OpenHAB::DSL::Items::Ensure::Ensurable Ensure} works on Enumerable
#   gLights.members.ensure.on
#   # or
#   gLights.members.ensure << ON
#
# @example Send a command to a list of items
#   [Light1, Light2, Light3].on
#   # or
#   [Light1, Light2, Light3].command(ON) # can't use <<, because that's already defined on Array
