      # Extensions for {Core::Items::GenericItem} to implement timed commands
      #
      # All items have an implicit timer associated with them, enabling to
      # easily set an item into a specific state for a specified duration and
      # then at the expiration of that duration have the item automatically
      # change to another state. These timed commands are reentrant, meaning
      # if the same timed command is triggered while an outstanding timed
      # command exist, that timed command will be rescheduled rather than
      # creating a distinct timed command.
      #
      # Timed commands are initiated by using the 'for:' argument with the
      # command. This is available on both the 'command' method and any
      # command-specific methods, e.g. {SwitchItem#on}.
      #
      # Any update to the timed command state will result in the timer being
      # cancelled. For example, if you have a Switch on a timer and another
      # rule sends OFF or ON to that item the timer will be automatically
      # canceled. Sending a different duration (for:) value for the timed
      # command will reschedule the timed command for that new duration.
