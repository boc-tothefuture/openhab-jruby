# @title Comparisons

## Type Comparisons

Some OpenHAB item types can accept different command types. For example, a {OpenHAB::Core::Items::DimmerItem} can accept a command 
with an {OpenHAB::Core::Types::OnOffType}, {OpenHAB::Core::Types::IncreaseDecreaseType} or a {OpenHAB::Core::Types::PercentType}. However, ultimately an item only stores its 
state in its native type, e.g. a {OpenHAB::Core::Items::DimmerItem}'s native type is {OpenHAB::Core::Types::PercentType}.

## Loose Type-Comparisons

Comparisons between two compatible types will return true when applicable, for example:

- 0 ({OpenHAB::Core::Types::PercentType}) equals `OFF` and the `off?` predicate will return true
- A positive {OpenHAB::Core::Types::PercentType} equals `ON` and the `on?` predicate will return true

```ruby
DimmerItem1.update(10)
sleep 1
DimmerItem1.state == 10 # => true
DimmerItem1.state == ON # => true
DimmerItem1.on? # => true
DimmerItem1.off? # => false
```

```ruby
rule 'command' do
  received_command DimmerItem1
  run do |event|
    if event.command.on?
      # This will be executed even when the command is a positive PercentType
      # instead of an actual ON command
      logger.info("DimmerItem1 is being turned on")
    end
  end
end

DimmerItem1 << 100 # => This will trigger the logger.info above
```

### Bypassing Loose Type-Comparisons

If at any point you want to bypass loose type conversions, use `eql?`.

```ruby
DimmerItem1.update(10)
sleep 1
logger.error DimmerItem1.eql?(10) # => false. It compares the _item_ object not its state
logger.error DimmerItem1.eql?(items['DimmerItem1']) # => true. It compares the _item_ object
logger.error DimmerItem1.state.eql?(ON) # => false
logger.error DimmerItem1.state.eql?(10) # => false
logger.error DimmerItem1.state.eql?(PercentType.new(10)) # => true
```

## Strict Type-Comparisons

Sometimes it is critical to know the exact command being sent. For example, a rule may need to distinguish between `ON` vs. a {OpenHAB::Core::Types::PercentType} command. In this instance, Ruby's case equality operator `===` can be used. It will only evaluate to true if the two operands have the same type.

The strict type comparison applies to Ruby's `case` statement because it is implemented using the case equality operator `===`

```ruby
rule 'command' do
  received_command DimmerItem1
  run do |event|
    case event.command
    when ON then logger.info("DimmerItem1 received an ON command")
    when OFF then logger.info("DimmerItem1 received an OFF command")
    when 0 then logger.info("DimmerItem1 received 0 percent")
    when 1..99 then logger.info("DimmerItem1 received between 1 and 99 percent")
    when 100 then logger.info("DimmerItem1 received 100 percent")
    when INCREASE then logger.info("Increase")
    when DECREASE then logger.info("Decrease")
    when REFRESH then logger.info("Refresh")
    end
  end
end

```

Regular expressions can still be used on a {OpenHAB::Core::Types::StringType} command.

```ruby
rule 'command' do
  received_command StringItem1
  run do |event|
    case event.command
    when /abc/ then logger.info('Command contains "abc"')
    else logger.info('Received something else')
    end
  end
end

StringItem1 << '123 abc 456' # This will log 'Command contains "abc"'
```
