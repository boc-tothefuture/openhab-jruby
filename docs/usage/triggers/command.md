# Received_Command


| Options  | Description                                                          | Example                            |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| command  | Only execute rule if the command matches this/these command/commands | `command: 7` or `commands: [7,14]` |
| commands | Alias of command, may be used if matching more than one command      | `commands: [7,14]`                 |

The `command` value restricts the rule from running to only if the command matches

The examples below assume the following background:

| type   | name             | group      | state |
| ------ | ---------------- | ---------- | ----- |
| Number | Alarm_Mode       | AlarmModes | 7     |
| Number | Alarm_Mode_Other | AlarmModes | 7     |


```ruby
rule 'Execute rule when item received command' do
  received_command Alarm_Mode
  run { |event| logger.info("Item received command: #{event.command}" ) }
end
```

```ruby
rule 'Execute rule when item receives specific command' do
  received_command Alarm_Mode, command: 7
  run { |event| logger.info("Item received command: #{event.command}" ) }
end
```

```ruby
rule 'Execute rule when item receives one of many specific commands' do
  received_command Alarm_Mode, commands: [7,14]
  run { |event| logger.info("Item received command: #{event.command}" ) }
end
```

```ruby
rule 'Execute rule when group receives a specific command' do
  received_command AlarmModes
  triggered { |item| logger.info("Group #{item.id} received command")}
end
```

```ruby
rule 'Execute rule when member of group receives any command' do
  received_command AlarmModes.items
  triggered { |item| logger.info("Group item #{item.id} received command")}
end
```

```ruby
rule 'Execute rule when member of group is changed to one of many states' do
  received_command AlarmModes.items, commands: [7,14]
  triggered { |item| logger.info("Group item #{item.id} received command")}
end
```
