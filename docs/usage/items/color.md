# ColorItem

ColorItem represents a color. Note that it inherits from DimmerItem, so you can
call `on`, `off`, `on?`, `off?`, etc. on it. It's state type is an `HSBType`, which
is generally stored as Hue, Saturation, and Brightness, but has easy helpers for
working with RGB values of various forms.

| hue        | Returns the color's hue component as a QuantityType of unit DEGREE_ANGLE        |
| saturation | Returns the color's saturation component as a PercentType                       |
| brightness | Returns the color's brightness component as a PercentType                       |

| to_rgb     | Returns an array of length 3 PercentType, corresponding to red, blue, and green |
| argb       | Returns a 32-bit integer of 2-bytes per alpha/red/blue/green component          |
| rgb        | Returns a 32-bit integer of 2-bytes per red/blue/green component                |
