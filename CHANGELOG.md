# JRuby OpenHAB Scripting Change Log

## [5.0.0](https://github.com/ccutrer/openhab-jrubyscripting/compare/4.45.2...main)

5.0 is the first release of `openhab-jrubyscripting` as a fork of
`openhab-scripting`. Many thanks to
[@boc-tothefuture](https://github.com/boc-tothefuture),
[@jimtng](https://github.com/jimtng), and [@pacive](https://github.com/pacive)
for their work on the latter. The purpose of this fork is because I
([@ccutrer](https://github.com/ccutrer)) felt that I wanted to significantly
re-work some of the core structure of the gem to shed some of the technical
debt that had accumulated from organic growth, and to do so speedily without
waiting for full review from other contributors with limited time. That said,
here is a non-exhaustive list of significant departures from the original gem:

* Significant new features! In particular, see {OpenHAB::DSL::Items::Builder},
  {OpenHAB::DSL::Things::Builder}, several new triggers in
  {OpenHAB::DSL::Rules::Builder}, and {OpenHAB::DSL.profile}.
* Logging has been reworked. There's generally no need to
  `include OpenHAB::Log` in your classes. {OpenHAB::Log.logger} method now
  accepts a String to explicitly find whichever logger you would like, and
  {OpenHAB::Logger#level=} can be used to dynamically change the log level.
  Issues around the logger name while a rule is executing have also been
  resolved: the top-level `logger` will be named after the file, and the
  `logger` within a `rule` or execution block will be named after the rule.
  Loggers within class or instance-of-a-class context will be named after
  the class. These loggers will _not_ have their name changed simply because
  their methods happened to be called while a rule is executing.
* The documentation philosophy has changed. Instead of relying on a large
  set of markdown files to give both commentary and to document the details
  of objects, [YARD](https://yardoc.org/) is now the primary generator
  of the documentation site. Details of individual objects and methods are
  now documented inline with the code, reducing duplication, aiding in
  keeping them up-to-date and accurate, and being more rigorous in ensuring
  the documentation has every available method listed, and in a consistent
  manner. Some commentary and high level examples (such as this file) are
  still maintained as dedicated markdown files, but included in the YARD
  docs, instead of being a separate site that then links to the YARD docs.
* The testing philosophy has also changed. The
  [rspec-openhab-scripting gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/rspec-openhab-scripting),
  previously written as an independent project by me
  ([@ccutrer](https://github.com/ccutrer)), has now been merged into this gem.
  There is a tight interdependence between the two, and especially during the
  large refactoring it's much easier to have them in the same repository. This
  means that that gem is now the endorsed method to write tests for end-user
  rules, as well as the preferred way to write tests for this gem itself, when
  possible.
* Major re-organization of class structures. {OpenHAB::Core} now contains any
  classes that are mostly wrappers or extensions of OpenHAB::Core Java
  classes, while {OpenHAB::DSL} contains novel Ruby-only classes that implment
  a Ruby-first manner of creating rules, items, and things.
* As part of the re-organization from above, the definition of a "DSL method"
  that is publicly exposed and available for use has been greatly refined.
  Top-level DSL methods are only available on `main` (the top-level {Object}
  instance when you're writing code in a rules file and not in any other
  classes), and inside of other select additional DSL constructs. If you've
  written your own classes that need access to DSL methods, you either need
  to explicitly call them on {OpenHAB::DSL}, or mix that module into your
  class yourself. Additional internal and Java constants and methods should
  no longer be leaking out of the gem's public API.

### Breaking Changes

* Dropping support for OpenHAB < 3.3.
* The main require is now `require "openhab/dsl"` instead of just
  `require "openhab"`. The reason being to avoid conflicts if a gem gets
  written to access OpenHAB via REST API. It's probably preferred that you
  [configure automatic requires](docs/installation.md) for this file anyway.
* {GenericItem} and descendants can no longer be treated as the item's state.
  While convenient at times, it introduces many ambiguities on if the intention
  is to interact with the item or its state, and contortionist code attempting
  to support both use cases.
* Semi-related to the above, the `#truthy?` method has been removed from any
  items the previously implemented it. Instead, be more explicit on what you
  mean - for example `Item.on?`. If you would like to use a similar structure
  with {StringItem}s, just [include the ActiveSupport gem](docs/gems.md)
  in your rules to get `#blank?` and `#present?` methods, and then you can
  use `Item.state.present?`.
* Semi-related to the above, the
  {OpenHAB::DSL::Rules::Builder#only_if only_if} and
  {OpenHAB::DSL::Rules::Builder#not_if not_if} guards now _only_ take blocks.
  This just means where you previously had `only_if Item` you now write
  `only_if { Item.on? }`.
* {QuantityType} is no longer implicitly
  convertible and comparable against Strings. Use the `|` operator for easy
  construction of {QuantityType}s: `10 | "°F"`.
* The top-level `groups` method providing access to only {GroupItem}s has been
  removed. Use `items.grep(GroupItem)` if you would like to filter to only
  groups.
* `GenericItem#id` no longer exists; just use
  {GenericItem#to_s GenericItem#to_s} which does what `#id` used to do.
* `states?(*items)` helper is gone. Just use `items.all?(:state?)`, or in
  the rare cased you used `states?(*items, things: true)`, use
  `items.all? { |i| i.state? && i.things.all?(&:online?) }`.
* {GroupItem} is no longer {Enumerable}, and you must use
  {GroupItem#members GroupItem#members}.
* {GroupItem#all_members GroupItem#all_members} no
  longer has a `filter` parameter; use `grep` if you want just {GroupItem}s.
* `create_timer` no longer exists as an alias for {after}.
* `GenericItem#meta` is no longer a supported alias for
  {GenericItem#metadata GenericItem#metadata}.
* Triggers (such as {OpenHAB::DSL::Rules::Builder#changed changed},
  {OpenHAB::DSL::Rules::Builder#updated updated}, and
  {OpenHAB::DSL::Rules::Builder#received_command received_command} that
  previously took a splat _or_ an Array of Items now _only_ take a splat.
  This just means instead of `changed [Item1, Item2]` you write
  `changed Item1, Item2`, or if you have an actual array you write
  `changed(*item_array)`. This greatly simplifies the internal code that has to
  distinguish between {GroupItem::Members GroupItem::Members} and other
  types of collections of items.
* Date and time objects have been reworked:
  * `TimeOfDay` has been replaced with {LocalTime}
  * Date/time objects are no longer comparable to strings.
    Please use the correct type.
  * Comparisons among the varying date/time classes all work.
  * The global `between` method is gone. Just form your range
    with the proper underlying type.
  * `between?` method is gone. Use `Range#cover?`: `my_range.cover?(date)`
    instead of `date.between?(my_range)`.
  * See also [Working With Time](docs/usage/time.md)
  * Add `#ago` and `#from_now` methods to {Duration}
  * Persistence methods no longer accept a {Duration}. Please use `Duration#ago`
    instead.
