Feature:  number_item
  Rule languages supports Number Items

  Background:
    Given Clean OpenHAB with latest Ruby Libraries
    And group "Numbers"
    And items:
      | type   | name       | label      | group   | state |
      | Number | NumberOne  | Number One | Numbers | 0     |
      | Number | NumberTwo  | Number Two | Numbers | 70    |
      | Number | NumberNull | Number     |         | NULL  |

  Scenario Outline: NumberItem supports math operations
    Given item "NumberOne" state is changed to "<initial>"
    And code in a rules file
      """
      NumberOne << NumberOne<operator> <operand>
      """
    When I deploy the rules file
    Then "NumberOne" should be in state "<final>" within 5 seconds
    Examples:
      | initial | operator | operand | final |
      | 50      | +        | 2       | 52    |
      | 50      | -        | 2       | 48    |
      | 50      | /        | 2       | 25    |
      | 50      | *        | 2       | 100   |
      | 50      | +        | 2.0     | 52    |
      | 50      | -        | 2.0     | 48    |

      | 50      | *        | 2.0     | 100   |
