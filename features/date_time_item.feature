Feature: date_time_item
  Rule language supports DateTime Items

  Background:
    Given Clean OpenHAB with latest Ruby Libraries
    And group "Dates"
    And items:
      | type     | name      | label      | group | state                     |
      | DateTime | DateOne   | Date One   | Dates | 1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00 |
      | DateTime | DateTwo   | Date Two   | Dates | 2021-01-31T08:00:00+00:00 |
      | DateTime | DateThree | Date Three | Dates | 2021-01-31T14:00:00+06:00 |

  Scenario Outline: DateTime Items support math operations
    Given item "DateOne" state is changed to "<initial>"
    And code in a rules file
      """
        DateOne << DateOne<operator> <operand>
      """
    When I deploy the rules file
    Then "DateOne" should be in state "<final>" within 5 seconds
    Examples:
      | initial                  | operator | operand    | final                        |
      | 1970-01-31T08:00:00+0200 | +        | 600        | 1970-01-31T08:10:00.000+0200 |
      | 1970-01-31T08:00:00+0000 | -        | 600        | 1970-01-31T07:50:00.000+0000 |
      | 1970-01-31T08:00:00+0000 | +        | '00:05'    | 1970-01-31T08:05:00.000+0000 |
      | 1970-01-31T08:00:00+0200 | -        | '00:05'    | 1970-01-31T07:55:00.000+0200 |
      | 1970-01-31T08:00:00+0000 | +        | 20.minutes | 1970-01-31T08:20:00.000+0000 |
      | 1970-01-31T08:00:00+0000 | -        | 20.minutes | 1970-01-31T07:40:00.000+0000 |

  Scenario Outline: Ruby Time methods work
    Given code in a rules file
      """
        logger.info(DateTwo.<method>)
      """
    When I deploy the rules file
    Then It should log "<result>" within 5 seconds
    Examples:
      | method  | result |
      | sunday? | true   |
      | monday? | false  |
      | wday    | 0      |
      | utc?    | true   |
      | month   | 1      |
      | zone    | Z      |

  Scenario: Items with same time but different zone should be equal
    Given code in a rules file
      """
        if DateTwo == DateThree
          logger.info("Same date")
        end
      """
    When I deploy the rules file
    Then It should log "Same date" within 5 seconds

  Scenario: Items can be updated by ruby Time objects
    Given code in a rules file
      """
        DateOne << Time.at(60 * 60 * 24).utc
      """
    When I deploy the rules file
    Then "DateOne" should be in state "1970-01-02T00:00:00.000+0000" within 5 seconds

  Scenario Outline: Calculating time differences work
    Given item "DateOne" state is changed to "2021-01-31T09:00:00+00:00"
    And code in a rules file
      """
        logger.info((DateOne - <operand>).to_i)
      """
    When I deploy the rules file
    Then It should log "<result>" within 5 seconds

      | operand                     | result |
      | '2021-01-31T07:00:00+00:00' | 7200   |

      | DateTwo                     | 3600   |

  Scenario: DateTimeItems work with TimeOfDay ranges
    Given code in a rules file

      """
    When I deploy the rules file

  Scenario: between-ranges can be created from DateTimeItems

      """
